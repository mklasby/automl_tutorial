# How to run
Install conda if not already on your system. 

Build from environment file with `conda env create -f environment.yml`

Build testing on MacOS and Windows 10. If you have issues with specific packages, try removing the version constraint in env file.

## Optional for model_search only (not reviewed in class):
Run `build.sh` (UNIX) or `build.bat` (WIN) if you want to experiment with model_search. You will also need to install
the /model_search/requirements.txt in a separate virtual env (conda or sim.)
